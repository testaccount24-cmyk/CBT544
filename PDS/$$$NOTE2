The five books on PL360 from the Stanford University archives, which
have been scanned in, and are in .PDF format, are in my possession.
I have deemed them to be too big to include right now, on the CBT Tape,
in their present format.  If I can OCR them later, all to the good,
but right now, they're downright enormous.  I think they deserve to be
put on a cd-rom.  If anyone wants these materials, please contact:

     Sam Golob at sbgolob@attglobal.net

or they can be downloaded from Stanford University's FTP site, given
the URLs on member $$$NOTE1.
